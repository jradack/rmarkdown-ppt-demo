# What is R Markdown?

R Markdown is an extension of Markdown, a popular plain text markup language.
Unlike "What You See is What You Get" (WYSIWYG) editors like Microsoft Word or PowerPoint, formatting is dictated through the text in the file rather than buttons or menu options.

R Markdown has the additional benefit of being able to integrate R code into the output document through code chunks.
This means you can clean data, run an analysis, and produce tables and figures all within a single file that will create an integrated output document.

## Benefits

Some of the benefits of using R Markdown include:

- **Reproducibility**:
The same inputs will yield the same outputs.
- **Efficiency**:
Since the R code and text are integrated into a single output, there is no need to copy and paste results from an analysis file into the cleaned output file.
- **Collaboration**:
Thanks to better efficiency, R Markdown makes it easier to edit and tweak and analysis, and share the results more quickly.
- **Flexibility**:
A single R Markdown document can be used to produce multiple different outputs, including Word, pdf, PowerPoint, and HTML, with minimal changes needed.


# R Markdown Basics

R Markdown combines Markdown syntax with R code blocks to generate documents.
Both elements are written as plain text in a single file, and rendered into various output types through the R package `knitr` and the program `pandoc`.

## Markdown Syntax

Content is split up using the symbol `#` for section headers, with the number of `#` indicating the level of the header.

```markdown
# Level 1 Header
## Level 2 Header
### Level 3 Header
#### Level 4 Header
```

Standard text formatting can be accomplished using Markdown.

| Operation | Syntax | Result |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| Italic | `*italic*` | *italic* |
| Bold | `**bold**` | **bold** |
| Strikeout | `~~strikeout~~` | ~~strikeout~~ |
| Subscript | `Some Text~subscript~` | Some Text~subscript~ |
| Superscript | `Some Text^superscript^` | Some Text^superscript^ |
| Verbatim/code | `` `verbatim` `` | `verbatim` |

### Lists

Markdown can create numbered and unnumbered lists.
The level of the list is controlled by the amount of indentation - use tab or at least 4 spaces to create a sublevel.
Make sure to leave an empty line before and after the list items for it to render properly.

::::{.flex-container}

:::{}

Here is the markdown...

```markdown
1. Item One
2. Item Two
    1. Subitem One
    2. Subitem Two
        1. Sub-subitem One
3. Item Three
```

:::

:::{}

...which will look like this:

1. Item One
2. Item Two
    1. Subitem One
    2. Subitem Two
        1. Sub-subitem One
3. Item Three

:::

::::

Unnumbered lists can be made using the symbols `*`, `-`, or `+`.

::::{.flex-container}

:::{}

Here is the markdown...

```markdown
* Item One
* Item Two
    * Subitem One
    * Subitem Two
        * Sub-subitem One
* Item Three
```
:::

:::{}

...which will look like this:

* Item One
* Item Two
    * Subitem One
    * Subitem Two
        * Sub-subitem One
* Item Three

:::

### Math Expressions

Mathematical symbols and expressions can be formatted using `$` thanks to `pandoc`.
These can be inline with other text, like so: $A = \pi r^2$.
They can also be displayed more prominently like so:
$$x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$$
R Studio will even include a nice preview to show you what your equation will look like after rendering.

### Block Quotations

Longer chunks of quoted text can be formatted using the symbol `>`.

## R Markdown Syntax

R Markdown extends Markdown's syntax by allowing for the inclusion of chunks of R code, which will be evaluated when the document is rendered.
Any output from the R code (e.g. tables, plots, model output) will be inserted into the output document.

### YAML Header

The YAML header is a block of code appearing at the very beginning of an R Markdown file, controlling the options for the output file, including what the file type will be.
It begins and ends with `---`, and consists of a list of keyword - value pairs.
Here is a basic example for rendering an HTML file:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
---
title: "Document Title"
author: "Author Name"
date: "MM/DD/YYYY"
output:
  html_document
---
```

### Code Blocks

What makes R Markdown unique is the ability to insert and evaluate blocks of code within the plain text document.
The syntax for a block of code is the following:

````markdown
`r ''````{r}
# Code goes here
```
````



#### Code Block Options

Aspects of code blocks and their output can be controlled by options.
Here is a (non-exhaustive) list of some useful options:

| Option | Value | Effect |
|--------|-------|--------|
| `echo` | `TRUE` or `FALSE` | Controls the display of code in output. |
| `eval` | `TRUE` or `FALSE` | Controls whether to run the code chunk. |
| `include`| `TRUE` or `FALSE` | Controls whether to include a code chunk in output at all. |
| `results` | `"markup"`, `"asis"`, `"hide"`, or `"hold"` | Controls how the output of a code chunk is displayed in the output document. |
| `fig.width` <br> `fig.height` | A number | Plot dimension in inches. |

### Inline Code


### Rendering Output


# PowerPoint Specifics

One of the many formats that R Markdown can render output to is PowerPoint.
We will explore some of the syntax and functionality for creating a PowerPoint presentation.

## Getting Started

The first step is to make sure we have the correct output type in our YAML header:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
---
title: "Presentation Title"
author: "Author Name"
date: "MM/DD/YYYY"
output:
  powerpoint_presentation
---
```

## New Slides

Markdown section headers are the main way a new slide are generated.
A new slide with no header can be manually inserted using the horizontal rule `---`.
