# What is R Markdown?

R Markdown is an extension of Markdown, a popular plain text markup language.
Unlike "What You See is What You Get" (WYSIWYG) editors like Microsoft Word or PowerPoint, formatting is dictated through the text in the file rather than buttons or menu options.

R Markdown has the additional benefit of being able to integrate R code into the output document through code chunks.
This means you can clean data, run an analysis, and produce tables and figures all within a single file that will create an integrated output document.

## Benefits

Some of the benefits of using R Markdown include:

- **Reproducibility**:
The same inputs will yield the same outputs.
- **Efficiency**:
Since the R code and text are integrated into a single output, there is no need to copy and paste results from an analysis file into the cleaned output file.
- **Collaboration**:
Thanks to better efficiency, R Markdown makes it easier to edit and tweak and analysis, and share the results more quickly.
- **Flexibility**:
A single R Markdown document can be used to produce multiple different outputs, including Word, pdf, PowerPoint, and HTML, with minimal changes needed.


# R Markdown Basics

R Markdown combines Markdown syntax with R code blocks to generate documents.
Both elements are written as plain text in a single file, and rendered into various output types through the R package `knitr` and the program `pandoc`.

## Markdown Syntax

| Operation | Syntax | Result |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| Italic | `*italic*` | *italic* |
| Bold | `**bold**` | **bold** |
| Strikeout | `~~strikeout~~` | ~~strikeout~~ |
| Subscript | `Some Text~subscript~` | Some Text~subscript~ |
| Superscript | `Some Text^superscript^` | Some Text^superscript^ |
| Verbatim/code | ``verbatim`` | `verbatim` |

### Lists

Markdown can create numbered and unnumbered lists.
The level of the list is controlled by 
Make sure to leave an empty line before and after the list items for it to render properly.

1. Item One
2. Item Two
  1. Subitem One
  2. Subitem Two
    1. Sub-subitem One
3. Item Three

Unnumbered lists can be made using the symbols `*`, `-`, or `+`.

* Item One
* Item Two
  * Subitem One
  * Subitem Two
    * Sub-subitem One
* Item Three

### Math Expressions

Mathematical symbols and expressions can be formatted using `$` thanks to `pandoc`.
These can be inline with other text, like so: $A = \pi r^2$.
They can also be displayed more prominently like so:
$$x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$$
R Studio will even include a nice preview to show you what your equation will look like after rendering.

### Block Quotations

Longer chunks of quoted text can be formatted using the symbol `>`.
